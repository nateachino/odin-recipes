    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 10 pieces</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 quart buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sprinkle chicken pieces with salt and pepper; place them in a deep-sided
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk buttermilk, hot pepper sauce, and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
        together in a large bowl; pour over chicken, tossing to coat all sides.
        Cover the dish with plastic wrap; marinate in the refrigerator for about
        2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from buttermilk mixture; shake off excess. Discard
        remaining buttermilk mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place flour, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, garlic powder, paprika, salt,
        and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag; shake well to combine.
        Place 2 or 3 pieces of chicken at a time into the plastic bag and shake
        well to coat chicken pieces with seasoned flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently place chicken pieces into hot oil and fry until chicken is cooked
        through and golden brown, about 8 to10 minutes for breasts and wings,
        and 13 to 15 minutes for thighs and drumsticks. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C). Drain fried chicken on paper towels.
      </li>
    </ol>
